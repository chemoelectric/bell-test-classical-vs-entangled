An Ada program that simulates a two-channel Bell test polarized photon
experiment, both classically and with ‘entanglement’.

You can compile it with gcc like so:

   gnatmake -f -O3 bell_test_classical_vs_entangled.adb

You can run it for instance, like so:

   ./bell_test_classical_vs_entangled 45 67.5 1000000

Statistical data is printed out and, of course, the results are
similar for both simulations, because there is actually

    NO SUCH THING AS ‘ENTANGLEMENT’

To wit:

   φ1 =    45.00000°
   φ2 =    67.50000°

   number of events = 1000000

This program, and any like it that YOU write and run, are experimental
evidence of that hypothesis.

That physicists have not written and run such experiments is a
dereliction of their duty, as scientists, to follow scientific
method. They have not performed observations, even simple ones such as
this, before forming their hypotheses.

Contrary to their hypotheses, which they hypothesized without first
making observations, there is no such thing as ‘entanglement’.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This nonsense about ‘entanglement’ actually arose from the 1935 paper
by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR), which argued correctly that
quantum mechanics problems must be soluble by other means. The quantum
physics community has ever since, at least by majority consensus,
tried to hold a monopoly on its problems by insisting EPR were
wrong. ‘Entanglement’ and ‘non-locality’ arose as supposed properties
of quantum physics that distinguish it from classical physics.

Let us call this monopoly grip on QM problems ‘irreducibility of
quantum mechanics’. It is the assertion that only QM mathematics can
solve QM problems.

However, there are two points I can make that will, without
difficulty, demolish ‘irreducibility’, at least for those of us who
retain any respect at all for mathematics and logic.

The first is something that, to me, seems odd to have been overlooked,
which is that the assertion of ‘irreducibility’ is not about physics,
but about mathematics. It is the assertion that a WORD PROBLEM in
quantum mechanics can be solved only using the peculiar mathematical
methods of quantum mechanics. This is ABSURD. For one thing, the
problem will have isomorphic equivalents. A two-channel Bell test is
logically equivalent to a thoroughly classical arrangement of radio
transmitters, relays, and receivers! The fact is that, once written
down as a word problem, any method of mathematics may be used, and it
that method will, by logical necessity, reach exactly the same result
as the peculiar methods invented by Pauli, Dirac, von Neumann, et
al. This is true of ANY problem in QM. The entire field of QM is
‘reducible’. The only REAL advantage the peculiar methods ever have
had were of convenience.

Thus, whenever quantum theorists (Bell, Clauser, etc.) have started
classical calculations and reached results DIFFERENT from those of
quantum mechanics, it is simply because they made mistakes!

Which brings me to the second point, which concerns John S. Bell’s
perverse version of probability theory, upon which ‘entanglement’ is
based. In actual probability theory, the definition of a conditional
probability is

   P(a|b) = P(a∧b) / P(b)

where a and b are propositions and a∧b is their logical conjunction.
In Bell’s probability theory, by contrast, the definition of a
conditional probability is

   P(a|b) = P(a∧b) / P(b), but, if b has no causal influence on a,
   then P(a|b) = P(a∧b) / P(b) = P(a)

Advocates of this definition will give you longwinded justifications
for it, but you and I retain respect for mathematics and logic and so
understand there is no possible justification for it. But let us try
it out, anyway, and see what we can prove. Suppose I put a red ball
and a white ball into a hat and mix them up. I remove one of the balls
and set it aside. Now I look in the hat and see the red ball
there. Let a = the ball set aside is red, b = the ball in the hat is
red. According to Bell’s definition of the conditional probability,

   P(a|b) = P(a∧b) / P(b) = 0/(1/2) = 0
   P(a|b) = P(a) = 1/2

Therefore all real numbers are both equal and unequal to each
other. Also, division by zero is both valid and invalid. Etc. Indeed,
all things expressible in mathematics are both true and false, etc.

But watch for physicists to refer to this conundrum by some such name
as ‘Zero Equals One-Half Loophole’. They will simply dismiss it as ‘a
known bug’. This is the sort of thing they do when presented with such
evidence that they are committing scientific fraud. Whether it is
legally fraud is a question for courts to decide. I think that in some
cases it may well be. In most cases, I suspect it is a
university-induced dysfunction of the cerebral cortex, which we may or
may not be able to repair by remedial education and perhaps
psychiatry.
